 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 15 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

<user_request>

MISSION: Register on Airtable and confirm email

YOUR EMAIL: pebobem169@nrlord.com
REGISTRATION URL: https://airtable.com/invite/r/ovoAP1zR

YOUR TASK:
  Complete full Airtable registration using the email above, including email verification.

CRITICAL WORKFLOW:
  📝 PHASE 1: AIRTABLE REGISTRATION FORM
  -------------------------------------------
  - STEP 1: Navigate to https://airtable.com/invite/r/ovoAP1zR
  
  - STEP 2: WAIT 5 seconds for form to load
  
  - STEP 3: Fill registration form with these EXACT details:
    * Email: pebobem169@nrlord.com (EXACTLY this email, DO NOT MODIFY!)
    * Full Name: "Maria Rodriguez" (or any realistic name)
    * Password: "SecurePass2024!" (minimum 8 characters)
    
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Submit button "Create account" is DISABLED initially
    - It only enables when ALL fields are valid
    - If button stays disabled → check email format is correct
  
  - STEP 4: Click "Create account" button ONCE (only one click!)
  
  - STEP 5: ⚠️ CRITICAL - After clicking submit, you MUST:
    1. **WAIT 10 seconds** for page to process
    2. **CHECK current URL** - THIS IS THE SUCCESS INDICATOR!
       ✅ SUCCESS = URL changed from "/invite/r/..." to "https://airtable.com/" (base domain)
       ✅ SUCCESS = URL contains "/workspace" or "/verify"
       ❌ FAIL = URL still contains "/invite/"
    3. **IF URL DID NOT CHANGE**:
       - Check page for error messages
       - Read what the error says
       - Report error and STOP
    4. **IF URL CHANGED TO https://airtable.com/**:
       - Registration is SUCCESSFUL!
       - Proceed immediately to PHASE 2

  ✉️ PHASE 2: EMAIL VERIFICATION
  -------------------------------------------
  - STEP 6: Return to https://temp-mail.org/en/ (same tab or new tab)
    * This is where you got the email in Step 1
  
  - STEP 7: WAIT 10 seconds for email to arrive
    * Airtable sends confirmation email within ~10 seconds
    * Email subject: "Please confirm your email"
    * Sender: Airtable <noreply@airtable.com>
  
  - STEP 8: Refresh temp-mail page if needed
    * If inbox still shows "Your inbox is empty"
    * Click Refresh button or reload page
  
  - STEP 9: Find and OPEN the Airtable email
    * Click on subject link "Please confirm your email"
    * Email opens in view like: /en/view/{emailId}
  
  - STEP 10: Extract verification URL from email
    * Look for button "Confirm my account"
    * Or find text paragraph with URL
    * URL pattern: https://airtable.com/auth/verifyEmail/{userId}/{token}
  
  - STEP 11: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Navigate to verification URL
    * Open the URL IN THE SAME TAB/WINDOW (not new tab!)
    * Simply navigate/goto the verification URL
    * DO NOT click it with target="_blank"
  
  - STEP 12: WAIT 5 seconds for verification to process
  
  - STEP 13: CHECK verification success
    * Look for success message or redirect to workspace
    * Account should now be confirmed

ANTI-LOOP PROTECTION:
  ⛔ If you repeat the same action 3+ times → STOP and analyze
  
  Common issues & solutions:
  - ❌ Submit button disabled? 
    → Check all fields are filled correctly
    → Email must be valid format
  
  - ❌ URL not changing after submit?
    → WAIT full 10 seconds before checking
    → Look for error messages on page
  
  - ❌ Email not arriving?
    → WAIT up to 20 seconds total
    → Refresh temp-mail inbox
    → Check spam/all folders
  
  - ❌ Can't find verification link?
    → Look for "Confirm my account" button
    → Or extract URL from paragraph text
    → URL always starts with https://airtable.com/auth/verifyEmail/
  
  NEVER:
    - Click "Create account" more than once
    - Check URL before waiting 10 seconds
    - Open verification link in new tab
    - Wait indefinitely (max 30s for email)

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
  ✅ Registration successful:
    - URL changes from "/invite/r/xxx" to "https://airtable.com/"
  
  ✅ Email verification successful:
    - After opening verify URL, page shows success or workspace

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
  {{
    "status": "success|partial|failed",
    "email": "pebobem169@nrlord.com",
    "registration_completed": true|false,
    "email_verified": true|false,
    "notes": "Brief summary of what happened"
  }}

  - STEP 6: ⚠️ CRITICAL - After clicking "Create account", you MUST:
    1. **WAIT 10 seconds** for page to react
    2. **CHECK current URL** - did it change?
       ✓ If URL contains "/workspace" or "/verify" → Registration SUCCESS, proceed to STEP 7
       ✓ If URL contains "email" or "confirm" → Check page for instructions
       ✗ If URL is still /invite/... → Check for error messages on page
    3. **READ page content** - what does it say?
       ✓ "Check your email" or "Verify your email" → SUCCESS, proceed to STEP 7
       ✓ "Welcome" or dashboard elements → SUCCESS, proceed to STEP 7
       ✗ Error message visible → READ IT, report in output, set status=failed
       ⏳ Page is loading/empty → WAIT 10 MORE seconds, then re-check
    4. **DECISION**:
       - If registration succeeded (URL changed OR success message) → Continue to PHASE 2
       - If error occurred → STOP, report error in output
       - If unclear after 20s wait → Take screenshot, analyze, decide

  ✉️ PHASE 2: CONFIRM EMAIL VIA TEMP-MAIL
  -------------------------------------------
  - STEP 7: Open NEW TAB with https://temp-mail.org/en/
    * DO NOT close the Airtable tab!
    * Keep Airtable tab open in background
  
  - STEP 8: WAIT 30 seconds for confirmation email from Airtable to arrive
    * Look for new email in inbox
    * Email subject will contain "verify", "confirm", or "Airtable"
  
  - STEP 9: Find and OPEN the email from Airtable
    * Click on the email to view its content
    * DO NOT click links yet - just open to read
  
  - STEP 10: LOCATE the confirmation/verification link in the email
    * Look for button with "Verify", "Confirm", or similar text
    * Or find URL link that looks like verification link
  
  - STEP 11: COPY the verification link URL
    * Extract the full URL from the link/button
    * It should look like: https://airtable.com/verify/...
  
  - STEP 12: SWITCH back to Airtable tab (the one from STEP 1)
    * DO NOT open new tab for verification
    * Use the SAME tab where you registered
  
  - STEP 13: NAVIGATE to the verification link in Airtable tab
    * Paste/navigate to the URL you copied from email
    * This confirms email in the same browser session
  
  - STEP 14: WAIT 5 seconds for confirmation to process
  
  - STEP 15: CHECK if account is now verified
    * Look for "Email verified" or "Account confirmed" message
    * Or check if you're redirected to workspace/dashboard

ANTI-LOOP PROTECTION:
  ⛔ If you repeat the same action 3+ times:
    STOP → ANALYZE current state → TRY DIFFERENT APPROACH
  
  Common issues & solutions:
  - ❌ Button not working after 2 clicks? 
    → Check for inline error messages FIRST
    → Don't keep clicking - READ the error
  
  - ❌ Email not arriving after 30s?
    → WAIT up to 60s total (emails can be slow)
    → Check ALL emails in temp-mail inbox
    → Refresh temp-mail page if needed
  
  - ❌ Can't find verification link in email?
    → Use vision API to READ email content
    → Look for ANY clickable link
    → Extract URL manually if needed
  
  - ❌ Registration seemed to succeed but no email?
    → Check Airtable tab - maybe already verified?
    → Wait longer (up to 90s total for email)
  
  NEVER:
    - Click same button more than 2 times
    - Fill same field twice if already filled
    - Wait indefinitely (max 90s for email arrival)
    - Open verification link in NEW tab (use existing Airtable tab!)

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
  ✅ Registration successful if:
    - URL changed from /invite/... to something else
    - OR page shows "check your email" message
    - OR page shows dashboard/workspace
  
  ✅ Email confirmed if:
    - After clicking verification link, page shows success
    - OR redirected to workspace/dashboard
    - OR message says "email verified"

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
  {
    "status": "success|partial|failed",
    "email": "pebobem169@nrlord.com",
    "confirmed": true|false,
    "notes": "Brief explanation of what happened"
  }

  Status meanings:
  - "success" = Account created AND email confirmed
  - "partial" = Account created but email NOT confirmed yet
  - "failed" = Registration failed (error occurred)

REMEMBER: 
  - Use EXACT email pebobem169@nrlord.com
  - Open verification link in SAME tab as registration (not new tab)
  - After clicking "Create account", MUST wait and analyze result before proceeding

Expected output format: RegistrationResult

{
  "thinking": "I have repeatedly tried to register on Airtable, but the URL has not changed, and I have not seen any explicit success messages. The previous attempts to scroll down to find error messages also failed to yield any new information. Looking at the screenshot, I can see that the 'Create account' button (index 6) is still present, and the input fields (1, 2, 3) are filled with the correct data. There are no visible error messages on the current screen. It's possible that the page is not fully loading or there's a hidden error. I will try to click the 'Create account' button again, and then immediately take a screenshot to see if any new elements or error messages appear. I will also check the URL again after a short wait.",
